Fall is a fuzzy finder for Vim and Neovim, implemented in [Denops], and stands
for **"Filter All."**

See [Features](https://github.com/vim-fall/fall.vim/wiki/Features) for more information about Fall's features.

> [!WARNING]
>
> This is a beta version. Please be aware that there might be
> backward-incompatible changes.

[Denops]: https://github.com/vim-denops/denops.vim

## Requirements

Users must install [Deno] version 2.x. Additionally, the `nerdfont` renderer is
enabled by default, so configure your terminal to use a [NerdFont], or disable
it by removing the `builtin.renderer.nerdfont` renderer from the custom file
(`:FallCustom`).

[Deno]: https://deno.land
[NerdFont]: https://www.nerdfonts.com

Note that Deno version 1.x is not tested and not supported.

## Installation

To install [Denops] and this plugin using your preferred plugin manager, such as
[vim-plug], add the following lines to your Vim configuration:

```vim
Plug 'vim-denops/denops.vim'
Plug 'vim-fall/fall.vim'
```

[vim-plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

## Usage

Use the `:Fall` command to open the fuzzy finder. The command accepts the
following arguments:

```
Fall {source} {source_args}...
```

For example, if you'd like to use the `file` source, you can use the following:

```
Fall file
```

Or use the `line` source with `README.md` as an argument:

```
Fall line README.md
```

### Mappings

Users can view available mappings by pressing `<F1>` in the picker window. See
the [Mappings](https://github.com/vim-fall/fall.vim/wiki/Mappings) page for more details.

### Configuration

In Fall, settings that utilize Vim’s built-in functionality are categorized as
“Configuration.” This includes key mappings, highlights, and buffer option
modifications.

Refer to the [Configuration](https://github.com/vim-fall/fall.vim/wiki/Configuration) page on the GitHub Wiki for
more details.

### Customization

In Fall, settings written in TypeScript to enhance Fall’s functionality are
categorized as “Customization.” These specifically refer to modifications made
to the user customization file, which can be accessed via the `FallCustom`
command.

Visit the [Customization](https://github.com/vim-fall/fall.vim/wiki/Customization) page on the GitHub Wiki for more
information.
